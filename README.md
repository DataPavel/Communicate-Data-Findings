### General Purpose and Description of the Project
In this project, I go through the exploratory and explanatory analysis.  
##### Purpose  

With this project I wanted to achieve some personal goals, such as:  
- Supplement statistics with visualizations to build understanding of data.
- Choose appropriate plots, limits, transformations, and aesthetics to explore a dataset, allowing you to understand distributions of variables and relationships between features.
- Use design principles to create effective visualizations for communicating findings to an audience.
